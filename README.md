# mobile_iron_incomplete

*IMPORTANT*: This code as-is is *NOT WORKING*. I am posting this as a reference so that hopefully others can benefit from it. 

This was written to query the MobileIron (MI) APIs using Powershell against a hosted instance of MI. 

I wrote this as a personal part-time hobby project to help me in a previous engagement. It once worked, but I had to clean it up before posting it here *AFTER* I lost access to that environment. So it has not been tested after those changes, therefore it is very likely broken now. 

It is very incomplete - I wrote these for very specific use cases and never meant to cover the breath of the MobileIron APIs. It is very much lacking in error checking/handling as you will see if you pesure the code.
